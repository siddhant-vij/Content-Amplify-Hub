# Content Amplify Hub

A Nodejs-based project which automates the process of fetching blog and social media posts from a Notion database & publishing them to Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, Twitter, and LinkedIn as per a specified schedule using GitHub Actions. For a user, all you have to do now is write & maintain your content in the Notion DB and the rest will be taken care of.

- Automatically fetches posts from Notion DB
- Publishes to blogging & social media platforms
- Scheduled posting based on specified times
- Success/failure updates sent via email
- Automated retries in case of failure
- Re-authentication in case of access token expiry
- Update Notion DB page with published URLs
- Workflow runners for GitHub Actions

## Environment Variables

### üöÄ Notion

Create a Notion Integration & get your API key:
https://www.notion.so/my-integrations

To share a page with an integration, visit the page in your Notion workspace, click the ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ menu at the top right of a page, scroll down to **Add connections**, and use the search bar to find and select the integration from the dropdown list.

- `NOTION_DOMAIN`: Get from Settings & members > Workspace > Settings > Public settings > Domain
- `NOTION_TOKEN`: Token on a Notion internal integration
- `NOTION_DB_ID`: To find a database ID, navigate to the database URL in your Notion workspace:

<br>

### üöÄ Dev.to

To obtain the token below, follow these steps:

Visit https://dev.to/settings/extensions

- `DEVTO_TOKEN`: In the "DEV Community API Keys" section create a new key by adding a description and clicking on "Generate API Key"

<br>

### üöÄ Hashnode

To obtain the token below, follow these steps:

Visit https://hashnode.com/settings/developer

- `HASHNODE_TOKEN`: In the "Personal Access Token" section create a new token by clicking on "Generate new token"
- `HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID`: **This worked as on 06-Jun-2024.**
If it doesn't, figure out a way. To find the publication ID, navigate to your blog home page URL. Open the DevTools Console:

```javascript
console.log(window.__NEXT_DATA__.props.pageProps.publication.id);
```

<br>

### üöÄ Medium

To obtain the token below, follow these steps:

Visit https://medium.com/me/settings/security

- `MEDIUM_TOKEN`: Click "Integration tokens" and create a new token by entering the description & clicking on "Get token"
- `MEDIUM_AUTHOR_ID`: Run the following command in your own terminal - in the project root:

```bash
node utils/mediumId/idOnce.js
```

<br>

### üöÄ Twitter

- `TWITTER_PROFILE_NAME`: Your profile name on Twitter followed by @

<br>

Follow the steps [@humanwhocodes](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2023/04/automating-tweets-v2-api/) to obtain the tokens below:

- `TWITTER_API_KEY`
- `TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`

<br>

### üöÄ LinkedIn

For the automated re-auth to work, the [Two-step verification](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/two-factor-authentication) needs to be turned off. Your email & password below will be used for re-auth with LinkedIn. Post re-auth, the access token will be updated in the GitHub secrets via API call (details below).

**Reason**: The access token expires in 2 months.

**_Alternative_**: To manually update GitHub secrets after performing a re-auth (before the access token expires) - in that case, no need to add the email & password below to your GitHub secrets. **_This is the preferred way right now._**

- `LINKEDIN_USERNAME`: Your LinkedIn email
- `LINKEDIN_PASSWORD`: Your LinkedIn password

<br>

Step 1: Register the App

Create a LinkedIn Page & App (verified) in LinkedIn Developer Network with redirect url set to http://localhost:3000/auth & following products added:

- Share on LinkedIn
- Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect

Copy the Client ID and Client Secret keys:

- `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`
- `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET`

<br>

Step 2: Generate Access Token

With all the above details provided, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node utils/linkedInAuth/auth.js
```

<br>

This will directly update the GitHub secrets via API call & also the local .env file with the access_token (required as ReAuth is only done locally).

- `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`

<br>

**Automated LinkedIn Re-Auth Worflow (on GA in production) will not be enabled in the future** as LinkedIn creates a 6-digit code-based MFA (even if two-factor authentication is turned off) - as a security measure which needs to be manually intervened to process further. This doesn't happen when run locally - maybe its location based trigger. Not sure - and thus, local automated reauth is preferred.

<br>

Step 3: Generate URN

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node utils/linkedInAuth/urnOnce.js
```

To be run only once to get the URN (in the terminal) for the LinkedIn User with the access token:

- `LINKEDIN_URN`

<br>

### üöÄ Email

- `USER_TO_EMAIL`: Your primary gmail - acting as recipient.
- `USER_FROM_EMAIL`: Your own secondary gmail - acting as sender. You can use the primary gmail if you want to.
- `USER_PASSWORD`: This is not the gmail password, but the app password generated at https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords. Use the `USER_FROM_EMAIL` for this.
- `SMTP_HOST`:smtp.gmail.com
- `SMTP_PORT`:465

<br>

### üöÄ GitHub

- `GH_USER`: Your GitHub username
- `GH_REPO`: Your GitHub repository name
- `SECRET_NAME`:LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN
- `GH_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and Generate a new (classic) token with "repo" scope & no-expiry.

## Usage Instructions

### Local Setup

You can clone this repository, then run the following command after installing the dependencies (`npm install`) & setting up he .env file:

```bash
npm start
```

<br>

### GitHub Actions

You can clone this repository. For GitHub Actions to work, add the workflow secrets to your GitHub Repository secrets at

**<a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; cursor: inherit;">
https://github.com/{GitHub-Username}/{Repository-Name}/settings/secrets/actions
</a>**

Here's the cron schedule set up in GitHub Actions. Change it according to your needs:

- For amplify workflow. The following determines when the workflow runs. It's the user's job to set it up in the Notion so that the blog posts are published on Tuesday & Saturday every week & social media posts go live daily. See the [Amplify Workflow](https://github.com/siddhant-vij/Content-Amplify-Hub/blob/main/.github/workflows/amplify.yml) for more details.
- For reminder workflow: To be run once every month which will send re-auth email reminder to the user - to perform the necessary steps locally. This is to ensure that the access token is updated in the GitHub secrets, which expires in 2 months. See the [Reminder Workflow](https://github.com/siddhant-vij/Content-Amplify-Hub/blob/main/.github/workflows/reminder.yml) for more details.
